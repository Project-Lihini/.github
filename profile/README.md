We’re pleased to announce Project Lihini, an open-source weather monitoring platform. Project Lihini aims to build an open-source, end-to-end weather monitoring platform. The aim is to create a weather monitoring platform that sources data from volunteers and makes the data available publicly. Everything from hardware to software is intended to be open source. This includes the hardware designs, firmware and web front-end and back-end.

The first commit is made to the Data Lihini Firmware repository, which marks the beginning of the public presence of this project. This repository contains the monitoring device's firmware that monitors, processes, and sends data to the online platform. The platform is based around the ESP8266 microcontroller with FreeRTOS as the platform. Development is done in PlatformIO along with VS Code as the IDE. This allows the project to harness the real-time capabilities of the FreeRTOS along with the wifi compatibility of the ESP8266.

This project is going to be crowd-sourced, and thus the public presence is crucial for the future of this project. This is why we created this blog: to create awareness of this project and to get feedback from the public. We hope to develop a powerful and useful platform that has an impact on society. For this, we appreciate all the help we can get…
